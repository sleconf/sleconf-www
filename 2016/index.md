The 9th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of [software languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_language): their design, their implementation, and their evolution. 

SLE 2016 is to be held on 31st October and 1st November 2016, co-located with [SPLASH](http://2016.splashcon.org/) and [GPCE](http://program-transformation.org/GPCE16) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

SLE's mission is to fuse several communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different and yet complementary perspectives: programming languages, model driven engineering, domain specific languages, semantic web, and from different technological spaces: context-free grammars, object-oriented modeling frameworks, rich data, structured data, object-oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming, term-rewriting, attribute grammars, algebraic specification, etc.

The next edition, SLE 2017, will be co-located with [SPLASH 2017](http://2017.splashcon.org/).
