The 9th International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of [software languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_language): their design, their implementation, and their evolution. 

SLE 2016 is to be held in October 2016, co-located with [SPLASH](http://2016.splashcon.org/) and [GPCE](http://program-transformation.org/GPCE16). More details will be announced as they become available during the course of 2015.

SLE's mission is to fuse several communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different and yet complementary perspectives: programming languages, model driven engineering, domain specific languages, semantic web, and from different technological spaces: context-free grammars, object-oriented modeling frameworks, rich data, structured data, object-oriented programming, functional programming, logic programming, term-rewriting, attribute grammars, algebraic specification, etc.
